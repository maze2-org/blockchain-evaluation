# Blockchain Evaluation

This repository contains a technical evaluation of smart contract development across multiple blockchains. For each chain, a minimal test project is implemented to measure developer experience from setup to deployment.

## Project Scope

For each blockchain:

- A basic ERC20-style token is deployed
- A smart contract allows minting 1,000 tokens in exchange for 0.01 native token
- A minimal DApp interacts with the contract

## Structure

- `Ethereum/smartcontract/`: Solidity smart contract using Hardhat
- `Ethereum/dapp/`: Frontend interface to interact with the contract
- Future chains will follow the same folder structure

## Goals

- Evaluate ease of setup and local testing
- Assess documentation and tooling
- Compare deployment processes
- Identify pain points and strengths

## Status

- âœ… Ethereum (Hardhat)
- ðŸ”² Solana (Anchor)
- ðŸ”² Avalanche
- ðŸ”² Sui
- ðŸ”² Aptos
- ðŸ”² Near
- ðŸ”² Injective
- ðŸ”² Polkadot

Each folder contains its own `README.md` with setup instructions and explanations.
